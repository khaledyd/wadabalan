Wadabalan is a full-stack event management application that allows users to create and attend events. 
This application is built using Node.js, React, Express, MongoDB, and Material-UI.

Wadabalan's user-friendly interface allows users to create events by providing a title, description, date, and location. Once an event is created,
other users can view the event details and RSVP to attend.

Material-UI is used to provide a consistent and visually appealing design throughout the application.
It's also offering live notifications when someone attend the event, and this will be sent to the creator of the event.
